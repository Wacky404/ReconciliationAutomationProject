# ReconciliationAutomationProject
A script that automates some Excel data reconciliation tasks for me. Goal was to go through a Excel database and grab all relevant data to populate into another.
This automation process has saved us substantial time in our reconciliation and data cleansing efforts, allowing for more time to be spent on the cleansing of data
so it can be intergrated into a new software.
